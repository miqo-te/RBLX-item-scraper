## Python3 & Chrome required

[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to run. If you use Python2 or don't have Python installed please upgrade to avoid conflict. The code utilises [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to scrape information correctly, make sure it is installed to the default path.
    
## Usage / Instructions

#### IMPORTANT: Before you start

Note that you should change the settings to be towards your liking in `settings.json` and to change `webhook_url` in `settings.json` to the webhook url from your Discord server's webhook.
